I am Huong-Giang Nguyen, or in short "Jan", PhD Student at Department of Strategy and Policy, NUS Business School. 

My research interests include global value chains, firm heterogeneity, environmental economics. I combine causal inference and structural estimation to understand firm operations in global production networks. 

I previously worked as a Research Associate at the Asian Development Bank, where I supported a randomized controlled trial in the banking sector.
